# Invoice App

This is a full-featured CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application for managing invoices. The application is built using modern technologies such as React, Context, and Chakra UI.

#### Form Management

The application leverages the power of react-hook-form to handle all the form operations in a seamless and efficient manner. The library provides robust form validation, error handling, and form management features, making it the perfect choice for this project.

#### Global State Management

Context is used for global state management, providing a centralized location to store and manage data that is shared across the application. This helps in reducing the amount of prop-drilling and makes the code more manageable.

#### Translation

The application supports multiple languages and provides a seamless translation experience to the end-user. This is achieved using the react-i18next library, which provides a convenient way to manage internationalization in React applications.

#### Styling

Chakra UI is used for styling the application, providing a rich set of UI components that are fully accessible and can be easily themed to match the branding of the application.

#### Continuous Integration and Deployment

The application has CI/CD set up, ensuring that every change to the codebase is automatically built, tested, and deployed to production. The application is hosted on Vercel, a fast and reliable platform for hosting web applications.

In conclusion, this application is a perfect solution for managing invoices and provides a seamless experience for both the developer and the end-user. The use of modern technologies and best practices ensures that the application is reliable, scalable, and easy to maintain.
